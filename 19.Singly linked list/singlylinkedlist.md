Singly Linked Lists

Objectives

1. Define what a singly linked list is
2. Compare and contrast linked lists with array
3. implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly linked lists

What is a linked list?

1. A data structure that container a hea,tail and length property
2. Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

Comparisons with arrays

Lists

- Do not have indexes!
- insertion via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

Arrays

- indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
