Insertion Sort

It builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

Insertion Sort Pseudocode

1. Start by picking th second element in the array
2. Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary.
3. Continue to the next element and if it is the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
4. Repeat until the array is sorted.

Implementation

Example 1:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var currentVal = arr[i];
    for (var j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentVal; j--) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
    }
    arr[j + 1] = currentVal;
  }
  return arr;
}

insertionSort([2, 1, 9, 76, 4]);
```

InsertionSort Big O Complexity

1. If the array is already nearly sorted, the time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(n) time complexity. Meaning that the time taken to sort a list is proportional to the number of elements in the list
2. If the elements in the array is so random, the time complexity will be O(N^2).
